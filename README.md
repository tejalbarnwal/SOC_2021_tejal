#### Maze Details
The space between walls is 16cm and the walls are all 0.02m thick (0.01m on each side). So the cell size is 18cm\*18cm with walls and 16cm\*16cm without walls. 
Also there are 16 columns and 16 rows in the maze. Thus the maze is of dimensions 16\*16 with each cell of dimension 18\*18. So, the number of cells is 256.
